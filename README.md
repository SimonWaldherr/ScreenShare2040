## Raspberry Pi Pico W Hub75-Display Project

This project utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico W ([Pimoroni Interstate 75 W](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/interstate-75-w?variant=40453881299027)) to drive a 64x64 Hub75 RGB LED Matrix. 
The display can show content from a web-based drawing canvas, uploaded images, and screen-sharing. 
It connects to Wi-Fi, allowing users to send pixel data via HTTP POST requests. 
A simple web interface enables easy interaction and content sharing. 
Future updates will include additional modes such as text input. 
This project is ideal for creating interactive and dynamic LED displays with ease.
